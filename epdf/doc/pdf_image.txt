PDF_IMAGE

-- width of the image in samples
-- height of the image in samples
-- number of color components per sample
-- number of bits per color component

-- rows of sample data


An image is a stream - * 


* Type	name (Optional)
	--The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes; if present, must be XObject for an image XObject.
* Subtype	name (Required)
	-- The type of XObject that this dictionary describes; must be Image for an image XObject.
* Width	integer (Required)
	-- The width of the image, in samples.
* Height	integer (Required)
	-- The height of the image, in samples.
* ColorSpace name or array (Required except for image masks; not allowed for image masks)
	-- The colorspace in which image samples are speci?ed. This may be any type of color space except Pattern.
* BitsPerComponent	integer (Required except for image masks; optional for image masks)
	-- The number of bits used to represent each color component. Only a single value may be specifed; the number of bits is the same for all color components. Valid values are 1, 2, 4, and 8. If ImageMask is true, this entry is optional, and if specifed, its value must be 1.
	-- If the image stream uses a ?lter, the value of BitsPerComponent must be consistent with the size of the data samples that the ?lter delivers. In particular,
	-- a CCITTFaxDecode or JBIG2Decode ?lter always delivers 1-bit samples,
	-- a RunLengthDecode or DCTDecode ?lter delivers 8-bit samples, and
	-- an LZWDecode or FlateDecode ?lter delivers samples of a speci?ed size if a predictor function is used.
Intent	name (Optional; PDF 1.1)
	-- The name of a color rendering intent to be used in rendering the image (see “Rendering Intents” on page 197). Default value: the current rendering intent in the graphics state.
ImageMask	boolean (Optional)
	-- A ?ag indicating whether the image is to be treated as an image mask (see Section 4.8.5, “Masked Images”). If this ?ag is true, the value of BitsPerComponent must be 1 and Mask and ColorSpace should not be speci?ed; unmasked areas will be painted using the current nonstroking color. Default value: false.
Mask	stream (Optional except for image masks; not allowed for image masks; PDF 1.3)
	-- An or array image XObject de?ning an image mask to be applied to this image (see “Explicit Masking” on page 277), or an array specifying a range of colors to be applied to it as a color key mask (see “Color Key Masking” on page 277). If ImageMask is true, this entry must not be present. (See implementation note 35 in Appendix H.)
SMask	stream (Optional; PDF 1.4)
	-- A subsidiary image XObject de?ning a soft-mask image (see “Soft-Mask Images” on page 447) to be used as a source of mask shape or mask opacity values in the transparent imaging model. The alpha source parameter in the graphics state determines whether the mask values are interpreted as shape or opacity. 
	-- If present, this entry overrides the current soft mask in the graphics state, as well as the image’s Mask entry, if any. (However, the other transparencyrelated graphics state parameters—blend mode and alpha constant— remain in effect.) If SMask is absent, the image has no associated soft mask (although the current soft mask in the graphics state may still apply).
Decode	array (Optional)
	-- An array of numbers describing how to map image samples into the range of values appropriate for the image’s color space (see “Decode Arrays” on page 271). If ImageMask is true, the array must be either [0 1] or [1 0]; otherwise, its length must be twice the number of color components required by ColorSpace. 
	-- Default value: see “Decode Arrays” on page 271.
Interpolate	boolean (Optional)
	-- A ?ag indicating whether image interpolation is to be performed (see “Image Interpolation” on page 273). Default value: false.
Alternates	array (Optional; PDF 1.3)
	-- An array of alternate image dictionaries for this image (see “Alternate Images” on page 273). The order of elements within the array has no signi?cance. This entry may not be present in an image XObject that is itself an alternate image.
Name	name (Required in PDF 1.0; optional otherwise)
	-- The name by which this image XObject is referenced in the XObject subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (see Section 3.7.2, “Resource Dictionaries”).
	-- Note: This entry is obsolescent and its use is no longer recommended. (See implementation note 36 in Appendix H.)
StructParent	integer (Required if the image is a structural content item; PDF 1.3)
	--The integer key of the image’s entry in the structural parent tree (see “Finding Structure Elements from Content Items” on page 600).
ID	string (Optional; PDF 1.3; indirect reference preferred)
	-- The digital identi?er of the image’s parent Web Capture content set (see Section 9.9.5, “Object Attributes Related to Web Capture”).
OPI	dictionary (Optional; PDF 1.2)
	-- An OPI version dictionary for the image (see Section 9.10.6, “Open Prepress Interface (OPI)”). If ImageMask is true, this entry is ignored.
Metadata	stream (Optional; PDF 1.4)
	-- A metadata stream containing metadata for the image (see Section 9.2.2, “Metadata Streams”).
