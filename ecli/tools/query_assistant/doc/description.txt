Query Assistant

Query Assistant generate access modules from "access descriptions".

An "access module" has a name and is desbribed by associating of SQL query, a comment, and hints
about the content of the parameter set and the content of the result set.

Why give hints about the SQL query ?  

Parameter sets.

Most ODBC drivers are unable to describe query parameters reliably.
Each parameter has a name and is described through a reference column (table, column). 

Many different SQL related to the same tables or views do have parameter sets
with many commonalities.  Parameter sets can be factored out through an "extend" attribute.
They extend a common virtual parameter set.

Result set

Result sets can be described automatically by ODBC drivers.
Their commonalities can be factored out trough an "extend" attribute.
Those result sets extend a common virtual result set.

Generated classes

Each access module leads to three classes

1) Cursor class - encapsulates the SQL query; 
2) Parameters class - hold parameter values
3) Results class - hold result values

Usage of generated classes.

Let
	p be an instance of C_PARAMETERS
	c be an instance of C a cursor class
	r be an instance of C_RESULTS
	
Scenario

1. instantiate c
2. instantiate p
3. give values to p attributes
4. associate p to c
5. execute c and start iterating on result set if any
6. current row values are obtained from c.item which is of type r
